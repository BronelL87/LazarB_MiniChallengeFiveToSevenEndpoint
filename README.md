MiniChallengeFiveToSeven - Endpoints

Created 4 endpoints for MadLib, OddOrEven, ReverseIt (Alphanumeric), and ReverseIt (Numbers Only) in a c# api



Peer reviewed by: Sebastian, 4:13pm
peer notes: All of the functions run properly when the correct input is given. This more specifically refers to OddOrEven and ReverseItNum. This is because those APIs require number inputs. However, only OddOrEven has data validation. ReverseItNum, when given a letter phrase, still reverses that when it should return a statement stating invalid. Update 2: The ReverseItNum now has data validation. It is fully functional.
